# Among Us - AR

An online multiplayer game with augmented reality inspired from the popular game - [Among Us](http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php)

## Introduction

This is an Augmented-Reality game inspired from Among Us. The idea is that players will have to gather together physically start the game. The rules are similar to among us. Crewmates will have to physically go to the tasks generated in the map. The map will be developed to where the game is played. Tasks will be placed at specific areas in the map along the roads). The task button becomes active only when the player is within a certain radius.
Imposters can kill crewmates when they are near a certain radius and also sabotage.
Dead bodies will be visible when a crewmate comes near to it.
During reports or emergency meetings, all functions will be disabled, and players will have to assemble together to discuss.
